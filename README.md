# Facility-location
An optimization problem to find the minimum number of warehouses such that the constraints below are satisfied. 

a. 80% of the demand is fulfilled via a warehouse.
b. Supply locations to be within 500 mile radius of a warehouse. 


Given a data set of factory locations, demand locations and demands of various commodites, I've solved the problem for minimizing the number of warehouses and located them on a map, using a heuristic with kmeans clustering. 



Part-2. 

Re-optimize the production at each manufacturing plant such that the production cost as well as the transportation cost is minimized.
